Q is there any way to attach a azure storage container to a azure vm?

In Azure, you cannot directly attach an Azure Storage container to an Azure Virtual Machine (VM)
in the same way you would attach a disk or a network share. Azure Storage containers are meant 
for storing unstructured data such as blobs, files, or tables and are accessed via REST APIs over HTTP or HTTPS.

However, you can access the data stored in an Azure Storage container from within a VM by 
mounting the container as a file share using Azure Files. Azure Files provides SMB (Server Message Block) 
file shares that can be accessed from Windows, Linux, and macOS systems. This allows you to access files stored 
in Azure Storage as if they were stored on a network drive.
